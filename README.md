# ChestFrenzy
This is a "cookie clicker" type game, but with chests!

##### Your main objectives are to:
----
    1) earn money
    2) open chests 
    3) upgrade luck multipliers
    4) buy unlocks 
    5) prestige! 
    6) repeat!!!!

##### Important to note:
    
    You can always manually save by clicking "Save" found in settings. 
    - If you exit mid-roll, you won't get the rewards from said roll 

    The tabs on the right "I, II, III" etc are Prestige tabs.
    Certain prestiges you unlock have a reward tab, drastically changing the game!

    The parallel open ugprade allows multiple batches of chests to be opened simultaneously.
